#script to setup the Bayesian Statistical Analysis package

#NOTE to get this script do:
#    svn export svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/atlasphys-exo/Physics/Exotic/JDM/DiJetISR/Run2/Code/StatisticalAnalysis/Bayesian/trunk/scripts/setup-StatisticalAnalysis.sh

#HOW TO: cd to the directory where you whould like to install the StatisticalAnalysis (Bayesian) code and then source the script; done!

#EXAMPLE:
#    mkdir ~/treasureisland
#    cd ~/treasureisland
#    svn export svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/atlasphys-exo/Physics/Exotic/JDM/DiJetISR/Run2/Code/StatisticalAnalysis/Bayesian/trunk/scripts/setup-StatisticalAnalysis.sh
#    source setup-StatisticalAnalisis.sh

#NOTE: you may use this script to setup the StatisticalAnalysis code every time you need it, it won't overwrite anything or re-compile unnecessarily


#check where the script is located
#stop if Statistical Analysis package is already available
